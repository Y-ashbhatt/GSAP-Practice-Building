# Dynamic SVG Animation with GSAP & ScrollTrigger

This project is a dynamic web page that showcases SVG animations controlled by GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and the ScrollTrigger plugin. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript to fetch and manipulate SVG graphics, combined with advanced scroll-based animations.

## Features

- **Dynamic SVG Loading**: The SVG file (`city.svg`) is dynamically loaded into the page using the Fetch API.
- **Responsive Animations**: Smooth scaling and transformations of SVG elements using GSAP.
- **Scroll-Based Interaction**: The ScrollTrigger plugin enables animations that are triggered and scrubbed by scrolling.
- **Pinned Section**: The animated section stays in place while the scroll animations play.
- **Multiple Element Transformations**: Animations include scaling, opacity changes, and positional shifts for various SVG elements.
